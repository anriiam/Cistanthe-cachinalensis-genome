# Cistanthe-cachinalensis-genome


Scripts used to assemble and annotate Cistanthe cachinalensis genome from Chomentowska et al (in press): "High-quality genome of the Atacama Desert plant Cistanthe cachinalensis and its photosynthetic behavior related to drought and life history."

MASTER_commands file contains the sequence of commands used, including calls to other scripts in the repository.

We also provide a python script to generate and extract upstream/downstream sequence from a target feature in a gff file, as used in the manuscript to identify regulatory motifs. 

Finally, the gene annotation of Cistanthe cachinalensis is provided in gff format.
